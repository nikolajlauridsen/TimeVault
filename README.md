# TimeVault
Lock your stuff away for a period of time

Really good for:
* Phones during meals and movies
* Snacks for people with poor self control
* ?? Only your imagination sets the limits

## Done
Finished this a while ago and the report has long since been handed in an returned (got a good grade whoop)

# Todo because I forget easily
* ~~Get a servo and actually make it lock/unlock something~~
* ~~Build the box to lock~~
* Add a red and green LED signaling locked/unlocked (Never got around to this)
* ~~Create a menu system~~
* ~~Create a mode where the user picks a date and time the box unlocks~~
* ~~Stuff I haven't come up with yet~~
