# TimeVault
Lock your stuff away for a period of time

Really good for:
* Phones during meals and movies
* Snacks for people with poor self control
* ?? Only your imagination sets the limits


# Todo because I forget easily
* Get a servo and actually make it lock/unlock something
* Build the box to lock
* Add a red and green LED signaling locked/unlocked
* Create a menu system
* Create a mode where the user picks a date and time the box unlocks
* Stuff I haven't come up with yet
